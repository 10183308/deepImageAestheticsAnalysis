We are releasing our codes/demo/dataset used in our project of image aesthetics analysis. This project is jointed done in Adobe Research and UCI.

The AADB dataset is large (2.0GB), so we attach it to google drive. The link is 
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxeylfSgpk1MOVduWGxyVlJFUHM
from where a small AADB can also be downloaded with resized images (256x256 pixel resolution, ~130MB).

Technically, the rank loss is implemented in caffe, and the relevant code can be downloaded here.

Some models are also released along with a demo interface. Running the demo can give you a clear way on how to load/interpret the model.

For further questions, please refer to our ECCV2016 paper or send me email through (skong2 AT uci DOT edu)
